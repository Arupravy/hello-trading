## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arupravy/hello-trading.git
   cd hello-trading

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. (Optional) Install the project in editable mode:
    ```bash
   pip install -e .

### Running the Simulation

- To run the simulation locally:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py

### Running Tests

- To run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/

### Docker Support

- Build the Docker Image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t hello-trading .

- Run the Docker Container
   ```bash
   docker run hello-trading

### Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub

1. Log in to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker login -u <your-dockerhub-username>
   
2. Tag the image:
   ```bash
   docker tag hello-trading <your-dockerhub-username>/hello-trading:latest

3. Push the image:
    ```bash
   docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/hello-trading:latest

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and Docker image builds. The workflow:

- Runs tests on every push to the `main` branch.
- Builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub on successful tests.

To view the workflow, check the [.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml](.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml) file.
